# Smart Form Builder

> Smart Form Builder is a dynamic form creation tool that empowers users to design custom forms with ease. Users can add questions and options manually or via drag-and-drop. Each option can have follow-up questions, allowing for deeply nested, conditional logic. Whether creating simple surveys or complex decision trees, Smart Form Builder offers a flexible and intuitive interface for building interactive forms.
